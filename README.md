# Learning GitHub Actions Demo

Small example showing how and for what we can use GitHub Actions. This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

This repository was created as a "fork" of my example [Learning Docker & Kubernates Demo](https://github.com/sswietoniowski/learning-docker-and-kubernates-demo). To fork your own repository we need to use some tricks ;-), nice explanation how to do that can be found [here](https://deanmalone.net/post/how-to-fork-your-own-repo-on-github/).
